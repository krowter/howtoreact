# Contributing Guide

Hello. If you'd like to contribute here (even just for ideas or typo fix) or add content, open up an issue first to better communicate your intent before making a merge request.

## What you need to start this app
- node and npm/yarn/pnpm
- clone this repo
- go to the cloned directory and run `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` `install`
- run `yarn dev`

## To create new content

1. Go to folder `/content`
2. Create new markdown (.md) file
3. Add `indexes` field (see existing files for references) <- these are used to search the content
4. Write the content in Problem, Why, and Solution structure
5. Commit. Push. Create a merge request. That's it :)
