# HowToReact

Collection of common questions about React JS with fuzzy search feature

## Background

I just wanna try out the [fuzzysort library](https://github.com/farzher/fuzzysort) but I don't know what to build, so why not an FAQ site with search feature?


## Disclaimer

This is not meant to be a replacement for Stackoverflow. It's just a quick lookup table for common errors in React

Thanks to [teknologi-umum blog's repo](https://github.com/teknologi-umum/blog) I found out about `gray-matter` and `fs/promises`.
